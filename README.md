# Asp.net-MVC-File-Upload

In MVC even html input type "file" is used to upload files but if we want to upload without page refresh then either we can use Ajax.BeginForm or ajax post. There is a jquery plugin called jquery.form.js which make the ajax post easily without making it complicate.

If you already know normal file upload just adding jquery.form.js plugin and few lines of code will do the trick. 

To do this follow these steps as mentioned at <a href='http://mitracircle.com/post/5/file-upload-without-page-refresh-in-mvc' target="_new">mitracircle.com</a>.
